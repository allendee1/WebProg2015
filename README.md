The fitness tracker is going to have various screens. 

The first is one that will contain all of the user's personal information, name, gender, size and weight and goals so that they will be motivated to achieve their goals. This will be the index page if they are not already signed in. This page will also be where they could upload their current progress for the day. It will ask for what exercise was done from a list of options. It will also give suggestions of what exercise to do next based on the results they are trying to achieve.

Another page will contain a calendar which will show the activity or progress in each and specific day. It will be a summary of what the person has done. The calendar will show everyday in a month. Each day on this page will show if any progress was made through some indication such as a check mark on a day. Some way there will be a way to see what was done that day. This includes how many calories was burned, what food was eaten, how much potassium you have taken up to that date, after adding all the substance from the different foods consumed. By clicking on a day, a person will be able to see exactly what they did, how much they ate, what foods they ate, how many calories they gained and how many calories they lost. 

Another page will be a food consumed tracker since food highly contributes to our fitness. In this page the person will be able to enter what they ate, how much they ate and an estimate on the calories that they have gained. Not only that but it will show all the nutrients that they have consumed and calculate the total of that in a day.  
Another slide will demonstrate which type of exercise was done, such as cardio, and will have some type of list with each of these with a check mark next to it and a suggestion of the next type of exercise to do based on all the other information obtained. 

Another page will have a community link where people could share their results and opinions to better improve their selves and the website. The idea is to be similar to reddit. People will have a section to post their concerns, dreams, and much more. By having a community, people will be able to be more social making the exercising more exciting.
